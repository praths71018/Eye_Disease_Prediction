# Eye Disease Prediction

## Introduction
This project utilizes a dataset of 712 ocular staining images to classify and predict eye diseases based on three main attributes: Category, Type, and Grade. The dataset encompasses a variety of corneal ulcer presentations, aiding in accurate diagnosis and treatment decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset contains images labeled with the following categories, types, and grades of eye diseases:

### Categories:
- **Category 0**: Point-like corneal ulcers
- **Category 1**: Point-flaky mixed corneal ulcers
- **Category 2**: Flaky corneal ulcers
    
### Types:
- **Type 0**: No ulcer of the corneal epithelium
- **Type 1**: Micro punctate
- **Type 2**: Macro punctate
- **Type 3**: Coalescent macro punctate
- **Type 4**: Patch (â‰¥1 mm)

### Grades:
- **Grade 0**: No ulcer of the corneal epithelium
- **Grade 1**: Corneal ulcers involve only one surrounding quadrant
- **Grade 2**: Corneal ulcers involve two surrounding quadrants
- **Grade 3**: Corneal ulcers involve three or four surrounding quadrants
- **Grade 4**: Corneal ulcers involve the central optical zone of the cornea
